Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I‚Äôm pleased to introduce myself. I am currently an engineer in Tianchou‚Äôs LAB ([OptVerse](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/optverse.html)) at Huawei, where I focus on the research and development of numerical solvers.

I graduated from the School of Mathematical Sciences at East China Normal University in 2019, under the supervision of [Professor Shengfeng Zhu](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~sfzhu/intro_c.html?language=1&id=177). In 2025, I earned my doctoral degree in Computational Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by [Professor Wenjun Ying](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/wying/).

My research interests lie primarily in scientific computing and computational fluid dynamics. I am also interested in machine learning-assisted modeling and computation. For instance, I have developed a physics-informed data-driven one-fluid cavitation model, as well as a hybrid numerical scheme (deepMTBVD) for compressible single- and multi-phase flows.

Currently, I am exploring how to leverage large language models (LLMs) to enhance and extend the capabilities of the numerical solvers we develop at Huawei.

If you share similar interests or have innovative ideas, I warmly welcome you to join us!
